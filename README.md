# INFSCI 109 1Project3
You've volunteered to be left behind by your army, making a final stand to cover their retreat at your lord's soon to be captured castle. It's up to you to kill as many goblins as possible, to slow stop the goblins from leaving for as long as possible, to ensure your lord's and comrade's escapes. It's a crap job, but somebody's got to do it, and you'll make sure to kill as many goblins as possible along the way!

# Features
Defend your castle from a swarm of goblin invaders with just your bow an your reflexes! This is a stationary VR archery game that requires you to remain aware of your surroundings to avoid being killed by the goblins!

# Controls
This is a VR game. For that reason, much of the controls come from your movements as a player. The camera moves with your head, the bow aims where you point it, etc. The only button that youn must use is the trigger button on your VR controller to nock and release your arrow!

# Note
This game was built and tested exclusively on the HTC Vive. For that reason, I cannot guarantee that it will work as intended on the Oculus Rift, though it is using the default Unity control scheme, so it should work on that VR system as well.
